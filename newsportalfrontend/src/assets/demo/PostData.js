        postbody:"Delhi Capitals (DC) managed to secure their first victory of IPL 2023 when they beat the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) with four wickets and four balls to spare at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi on Thursday, April 20. Despite the positive result, DC still finds themselves at the bottom of the points table with one win from six games.However, DC's batting struggles continued as they barely managed to scrape through in their chase of the 128-run target. Their batting lineup, boasting Prithvi Shaw, Mitchell Marsh, and Manish Pandey, has struggled this season with only skipper David Warner scoring consistently.During a discussion on Starsports, former Indian cricketer and selector Krishnamachari Srikanth was particularly critical of middle-order batter Manish Pandey. When asked to comment on Pandey, Srikanth refused to answer and said:\"Why are we talking about Manish Pandey? I don’t want to talk about him. The guy shouldn’t even be in the team. Let’s talk about Axar Patel, how he has been in the form of his life and deserves to bat higher. He shouldn’t be in this team. If I was the chairman of selectors, he wouldn't have played.\" Pandey has been one of the biggest disappointments over the last couple of IPL seasons after promising much in the early stages of his career. DC bought the services of the 33-year-old at the mini-auction for ₹ 2.4 crores after he was released by the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).",
